### This docs doesn't contain any technical concepts, you can refer original reactflow documentation for that

## 1. Nodes

Think of node as something like nodes in linkedlist, we can connect nodes to create a flow. we can manually set up Nodes and Edges or we can dynamically do that also. \[Add notes when some event occurs, add edges]

### 1.1 Node types

There are mainly 3 nodes (input, output and default). Apart from these, we can also create our own nodes called custom node.

*   Input Node - Input Node has 1 handle (connecting point) which is the source \[input]. that connects to other types of Node.

*   Output Node - Output Node also has 1 handle, which is the target \[output]. that allows output node to connect with other types of Node.

*   Default Node - Default Node has 2 handle, 1 for the target and 1 for the source.

*   There is also a group type, which is used to group nodes within a group.

## 2. Edges

Edges are the connecting path between nodes.&#x20;
